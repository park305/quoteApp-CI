Altered the quotes_relationships table for a unique constraint on three columns
ALTER TABLE quotes_relationships
ADD CONSTRAINT relation_unique UNIQUE (quoteID, relationID, relationType)

This makes it so that i don't have to check for duplicate category/tags attached to a quote in the code before updating a quote.
